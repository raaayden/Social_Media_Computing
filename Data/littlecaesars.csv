"@littlecaesars Yes I ordered a cheese pizza light sauce on the app, it‚Äôs one of my fav‚Äôs. I got there during the time it said it‚Äôd b ready.

@littlecaesars pretty disappointing. I love thin crust and pepperoni.  But this is cold and dried out.  Maybe it was in the trash or something until I pulled up to the pickup window.
