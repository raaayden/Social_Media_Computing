I’m hella mad at the pizza I got from @PapaJohns,-1
"@Tiffany03528709 @AlexKrallman @PapaJohns I think that this trend is smart because it allows companies who don’t sell traditional candy, cards, etc. to profit off of Valentine’s Day. I’ve seen heart shaped chicken platters from @ChickfilA and even heart shaped steaks from @Publix. #UABMKTG #ICMKTG",-1
@thaothun @krispykreme @dunkindonuts @PapaJohns 3) I agree that Valentine’s Day themed foods are fun and widely used in the food industry. I wonder if there are other ways restaurants could stick out by doing Valentine’s Day themed food. The first company to do it ‘different’ will be a sight to see. #NKU205 #ICMKTG,1
@bparizek @PapaJohns They must have been trying to cook the carbs out so you could stay on your KETO diet!,0
@CopywriterBob @substationii 2) I believe @ChickfilA is leading the way in romance marketing in the fast food restaurant industry! Their heart shaped food is unbeatable! Another leader in the food industry are pizza makers like @PapaJohns. #NKU205 #ICMKTG,1
